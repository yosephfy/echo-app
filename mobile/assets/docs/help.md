# Help & FAQ

Welcome to the Echo app! This page offers quick help and answers to common questions.

---

## 🔐 I forgot my password

At the moment, we do not support password recovery. Please create a new account or contact support if needed.

---

## 🚫 Why can't I post a secret right now?

You can only post **one secret per day**. A 24-hour cooldown is enforced after each post. The timer resets at midnight.

---

## 💬 What do the moods mean?

Each secret can be tagged with a mood (e.g. sad, relieved, angry). This helps others relate and navigate posts more meaningfully.

---

## 🛑 What happens when I hit “Panic Delete”?

Panic Delete instantly deletes your post from public view and marks it for removal—no one will be able to engage with it after that.

---

## 📩 I reported a secret—what now?

When you report a secret, our moderation system reviews the post and removes it if it violates community guidelines.

---

## 🔔 Why am I getting push notifications?

You’ll receive optional alerts for:

- Cooldown completions
- Secret review status
- Weekly stats (if enabled in settings)

You can disable these in your preferences.
